# Arabic-Obsolete-Words
A list of obsolete words in the Buckwalter Morphological Analyser

This is a list of obsolete words, or words that are outdated or not in contemporary use, in the Buckwalter Morphological Analyser database. This list is developed according to a threshold of frequency on the web and the Arabic gigaword corpus. The list contain about 8,400 words that fell out of current use with a margin error of 1%. The threshold is defined like this. All the lemmas in Buckwalter queried in three news web sites (al-Jazeera, Arabic BBC and Arabic Wikipedia) and if the lemma is not found in any of the three search engines, it is considered as obsolete. Then all the lemmas are queried in the Arabic Gigaword corpus (fourth edition) and if a lemma has a frequency of 10 or less occurrences, then it is considered as obsolete.
